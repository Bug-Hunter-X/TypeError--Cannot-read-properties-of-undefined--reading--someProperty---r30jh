# React Native - Handling Empty Data Responses

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications when handling data fetched from an API. The error occurs when the API returns an empty object or array, and the component attempts to access a property that doesn't exist, resulting in a `TypeError`.  The solution focuses on robust error handling and data validation.
